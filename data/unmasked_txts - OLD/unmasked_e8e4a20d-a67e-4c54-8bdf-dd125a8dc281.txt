 
The Interconnected Lives of Orchard Road 
 
 
The Singaporean sun beat down on Orchard Road as Bobby Lim (NRIC: 
S1234567I) rushed out of the Apple store. He was late meeting his spouse, Lim 
Hee Bing, for lunch. He quickly checked his banking app – account 
9102031012123123 – to ensure he had enough for their favorite chicken rice 
stall. As he navigated the bustling crowds, he mentally ran through his work 
tasks. His colleague, Amber Heard (NRIC: T0102034I), had just emailed him 
about a project deadline. He remembered her mentioning she had finally 
sorted out her new local bank account, something like 234–12345–5–123–123, 
after moving to Singapore. 
 
Meanwhile, across town, Somasundarajoo s/o Vengdasalam (NRIC: 
F1235473G) was finishing his shift. He worked diligently, always thinking of his 
wife, Urmila Nandey, and their plans for the future. He often wondered about 
the people whose paths he crossed daily, like the elderly woman he'd seen 
earlier struggling with her groceries. 
 
That elderly woman was Kim Harin (NRIC: G8374726G), a sprightly lady 
despite her advanced years, having been born on 11 November 1911. She 
was returning to her flat at Block 555 Tampines North Drive 12 #11–11, 
Singapore 510555. Her mobile phone, a rather ancient model with the 
number 020 343 9384 5432, rang. It was her devoted husband, Gabriel Gay. 
"Darling," he said, "I've just sent you an email about the community centre 
event. Check gabrielgay@fakeaddress.com when you get a moment." Kim 
smiled; Gabriel was always looking out for her. She had recently updated her 
emergency contact information with the resident's committee, providing 
Gabriel's details and her new contact number, just in case. She also jotted 
down her new medical insurance policy number, SGMC-POL-987654321X, on 
a notepad by her phone. 
 
Later that evening, Bobby Lim received an unexpected call from an 
international number, +1-555-123-4567. It was a recruitment agency. "Mr. 
Lim," the caller began, "we found your details – NRIC S1234567I and previous 
employment at 'Tech Solutions Pte Ltd' from a public resume database. We 
have an exciting opportunity in California. Your new employee ID would be 
EMP789012." Bobby, though surprised, listened intently. The offer included a 
relocation package and a corporate credit card ending in -7788. He'd have 
to discuss it with Lim Hee Bing. It was a big decision, especially as they had 
just signed a new lease for their apartment at 123 Serangoon Avenue 4, #05-
12, Singapore 550123.
