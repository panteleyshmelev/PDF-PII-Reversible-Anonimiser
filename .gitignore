# Data files (ignore contents, not necessarily the folders themselves if empty)
# If you want to keep the directory structure but ignore files within:
data/uploads/*
data/masked_pdfs/*
data/unmasked_pdfs/*
data/masked_txts/*
data/unmasked_txts/*
# data/masking_maps.json # Decide if you want to version this. For development, maybe. For production, usually not. Let's ignore it for now for simplicity.

# Specific generated files from your log (you can remove these lines if the above catch them)
# data/masked_pdfs/masked_*.pdf # This is covered by data/masked_pdfs/*
# data/unmasked_pdfs/unmasked_*.pdf # Covered by data/unmasked_pdfs/*

# Old directories (if you plan to delete them from your filesystem and Git)
# If you want to keep them locally but not in Git, add them here too.
# For now, let's assume you'll handle these separately if needed.
